Game of life engine having the following properties:
- any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, because of underpopulation.
- any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on the next generation.
- any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, because of overpopulation.
- any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Thus,
- any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
- any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
- all other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
