## Game Of Life

Transitions
* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, because of underpopulation.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, because of overpopulation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Rules
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
* Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
* All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
